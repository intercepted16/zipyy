# zipyy
Welcome to the source code of zipyy, a no-nonsense URL shortener built with SvelteKit, Tailwind, and TypeScript!

# Project Background
This project started 7 months ago. Initially, it used Flask, a simple Python library for web applications. After experimenting with various tech stacks, I settled on the current setup, which provides the best developer experience. Highly recommended!

# Why this stack?
SvelteKit: It's like HTML on steroids.

Tailwind: It has saved me countless hours of styling work.

TypeScript: It has significantly reduced debugging time by catching errors early.
